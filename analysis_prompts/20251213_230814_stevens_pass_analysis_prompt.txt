Post: Dec 11- Record rain and a hint of snow next week!
Source: https://www.powderpoobah.com/post/dec-11-record-rain-and-a-hint-of-snow-next-week

HIGHLIGHTS:
Friday: Light rain in the morning
Saturday: Dry with some sunbreaks possible
Sunday: Light rain except up to 2" snow late in the day at mid-slopes for Mt. Baker, Silver Mt, and 49 Degrees North
Monday: Windy and heavy rain

EXTENDED OUTLOOK:
This is an extended outlook, and the models have not been that accurate lately. Tuesday, expect cooler temps. By Wednesday chance of snow at 4000' (expecting 8"). Next update this Sunday, December 14. Hoping this optimistic outlook continues. What is very encouraging is looking toward Christmas, bringing very cold conditions. Interesting that all models have consistently shown this trend. We'll see if this trend continues and how much snow we get.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Spokane WA
933 PM PST Sat Dec 13 2025

.KEY MESSAGES...

- Dry conditions and decreasing river levels through Sunday.

- Rain and high mountain snow Monday into Tuesday to bring 
  additional river rises and mud and rock slide concerns to 
  Cascades and Idaho Panhandle.

- High winds possible Tuesday Night into Wednesday. A 30-60%
  chance for widespread wind gusts of greater than 50 mph.

- High confidence for heavy mountain snow impacting the Cascades
  starting Wednesday morning. 70% chance of 3 feet or more of 
  snow at Stevens Pass through Friday afternoon.

&&

.SYNOPSIS...
Drier weather is expected for this weekend with decreasing river 
levels. Next week, another very active weather pattern moves
through the forecast area. Rain and high mountain snow Monday 
into Tuesday will bring additional river rises with mud and rock
slide concerns in steep terrain of the Cascades and Idaho 
Panhandle. Very windy conditions will then develop Tuesday Night
into Wednesday, along with the return of mountains snow. Heavy
mountain snow in the Cascades is expected mid to late week. 

&&

.DISCUSSION...
...VERY ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN NEXT WEEK WITH RENEWED FLOODING 
CONCERNS FOR CASCADES AND NORTH ID PANHANDLE MONDAY INTO 
TUESDAY, POSSIBLE HIGH WINDS TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY, AND 
HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW FOR THE CASCADES WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Today through Sunday afternoon: A welcome break from cloud cover and 
precipitation will last through tomorrow afternoon. Temperatures 
remain much warmer than normal for this time of year, with highs 
today and tomorrow expected in the high 40s/early 50s. These values 
are 15-20 degrees higher than normal. 

Sunday evening through Wednesday: By Sunday evening, another active 
weather pattern makes its entrance as an atmospheric river moves 
through the state of Washington. Another plume of warm moisture 
comes through, raising PWATs across the forecast area from 90-100% 
to 250-300% of normal. Alongside ensemble PWATs, Enhanced Forecast 
Index values show anomalously high chances for temperatures (through 
midweek), rainfall, and strong winds, which will be discussed below. 
Temperatures for this first wave remain warmer than usual, and thus 
snow levels remain high on Sunday and Monday, with snow being 
confined to highest mountain elevations. By Tuesday, lower heights 
will start to move in ahead of an upper level low, dropping snow 
levels. On Wednesday, this upper level low will move through, and 
mountain passes will begin seeing accumulating snow. 

Rainfall: Because of antecedent conditions from the multiple 
atmospheric rivers that moved through last week, hydrologic impacts 
will continue to be seen. Multiple river forecast points in Chelan 
County including Stehekin River and the Wenatchee River show a 
forecasted increase in streamflows, either heading back into flood 
stage or coming close to it. Rain totals at the mountain crest to 
the upper river valleys (roughly 3000 feet and above) will total 
nearly 3-4 inches. NBM probabilities show Leavenworth has a 40% 
chance of seeing 3 or more inches of rain through early Wednesday 
morning. In the Idaho Panhandle, rain amounts of 1.5-1.75 inches of 
rain will fall, resulting in an uptick in streamflows for the Coeur 
d'Alene river as well. Chances for upcoming hydrologic headlines 
are increasing. 

Snowfall: As the trough off coast moves into the state of Washington 
on Wednesday, colder air will be advected into the area, lowering 
snow levels and bringing accumulating snow to mountain passes along 
the Cascades and Idaho Panhandle. With this second system, snowfall 
will be heavy and continuous. NBM probabilities show Stevens Pass 
has a 40% chance of seeing 2 feet of snow or more through early 
Wednesday morning. Blewett and Lookout Passes have a 20-40% chance 
of seeing 6 or more inches of snow during this time. Bottom line: 
expect wintry driving conditions and prepare accordingly, as roads 
may be slick. 

High Winds: Impacts to driving will be further hindered Tuesday 
night through Wednesday morning as strong westerly winds move 
through. A surface low dropping into southern Alberta will deepen, 
increasing the surface pressure gradient across the state. Right 
now, deterministic wind forecasts show westerly 850 mb winds 50-
65kts Tuesday into Wednesday. With cold air advection making mixing 
more likely, wind gusts at the surface will be strong. Areas that 
will see the highest wind gusts include the Wenatchee, Waterville 
Plateau, Spokane, basin, ID/WA Palouse, and Lewiston/Pullman areas. 
NBM probabilities are currently showing a 40% chance and higher of 
sustained wind speeds 25-30 mph. Many of these same areas have a 25-
35% chance of seeing wind gusts 55 mph or higher. A notable 
exception is Lewiston/Pullman, with a 50% chance of 55+ mph wind 
gusts. Wind headlines will almost certainly be needed if models 
continue showing such strong winds Tuesday night into Wednesday 
afternoon. 

Thursday through Friday: Snow will continue in earnest at mountain 
passes on Thursday, accumulating further. Blewett and Lookout Passes 
have a 30-40% chance of seeing an additional foot of snow through 
Friday afternoon. Stevens Pass will see considerably higher totals, 
with a 77% chance of seeing 3 feet of snow or more through Friday 
afternoon. Winter weather headlines will likely be needed mid to 
late week. Bottom line, expect another impactful week of weather, 
especially to mountain and foothill areas. 

Saturday through Sunday: Clusters overwhelmingly show continued low 
heights and another trough moving through the PNW next weekend and 
into the beginning of next week. This will result in continued 
chances for the active weather pattern to continue. The Climate 
Prediction Center's 8-14 Day Outlook also shows signals of a 
continued active weather pattern, with increased chances for below 
normal temperatures and above normal precipitation. /AS

&&

.AVIATION...
06Z TAFs: Light winds and VFR conditions will prevail for most
of the region. A potential exception will be KMWH, which has 
a 30% chance of fog development between 10Z and 18Z. Clear skies
in the lee of the Cascades will allow for efficient radiational
cooling, but unlike KEAT, KMWH is far enough east that 
downslope winds may not dry out the boundary layer enough to 
inhibit fog development.

.FORECAST CONFIDENCE AND/OR ALTERNATE SCENARIOS: High confidence
in VFR conditions for all sites except for KMWH over the next 24
hours. Low confidence in fog impacting KMWH. /Fewkes

-----------------------

Confidence descriptors:
Low - Less than a 30 percent chance
Moderate - 30 to 70 percent chance
High - Greater than a 70 percent chance

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
808 PM PST Sat Dec 13 2025


.UPDATE...Upper-level ridge axis is now well east of the
forecast area as mostly dry conditions remain. However, a weak 
front offshore will bring a shot of light rain and showers 
starting late tonight into Sunday. This feature won't be 
impactful but, it'll open up the pattern for the next 
atmospheric river to arrive Sunday night into Monday. Additional
rises on area rivers are favored with more detail provided 
below in the hydro section. Overnight lows tonight will bottom 
out between the mid 40s to near 50 F. The previous discussion is
below along with an updated aviation section. 


&&

.SYNOPSIS...
River flooding continues across areas of western Washington.
Drier conditions will persist through tonight, before a weak 
front crosses the region early Sunday. A stronger system will 
follow Monday into Tuesday, bringing heavier precipitation and 
strong winds for some areas. A deeper trough will bring cooler 
air and the potential for heavy mountain snow Tuesday night into 
Wednesday. Conditions remain unsettled heading into late week
with additional rounds of lowland rain and mountain snow
expected.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/... 
Most areas of fog have scattered across the region this 
afternoon with latest satellite imagery showing high cloud 
cover streaming in overhead. Conditions will generally remain 
dry across the region through tonight with high pressure
situated over the region. 

The break in the weather will remain short-lived, however, as 
the ridge flattens into Sunday and the next weak frontal system
approaches western Washington. Rain will move inland by early 
Sunday, but expect overall amounts to remain rather light, with 
most areas only expected to receive a few hundredths to a tenth 
of an inch across the interior and a few tenths along the coast.
Snow levels will remain rather high- generally between 6000-8000
ft - so rainfall amounts in the mountains are generally expected
to range from a quarter of an inch to an inch in spots, but are
not expected to bring additional impacts at this time.

14

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/... 
Models remain consistent with regards to next atmospheric river
system getting into full swing early Monday morning and bringing
another round of significant rainfall throughout the day. QPF 
amounts with this particular system are lower than with the 
prior AR with lowland rainfall amounts generally in the half-
inch to three- quarters of an inch. The problem arises when 
considering the impacts this new rainfall may have on already 
existing conditions from prior AR. Needless to say, flooding due
to already elevated river levels and landslides due to already 
saturated ground top that list. However, this is both not as bad
as it appears to be and just as bad as it appears to be. To 
cover the first part of that statement, precip amounts favor 
falling mostly in the first half of the day, tapering off in the
afternoon and evening...even though PoPs throughout the day 
remain high. Making the situation as bad as it appears, or 
perhaps worse, is the follow-up frontal system Tuesday, drawing 
in a much more significant slug of moisture into the area. This 
will result in lowland rainfall amounts of 0.75 inches on the 
low end and as high as 1.50 inches on the high end. The 
cumulative effects of Monday and Tuesday will certainly compound
already existing issues over the area. Lastly, winds during the
day on Monday will be elevated with most locations in the CWA 
becoming breezy to locally windy. Locations more prone to higher
wind speeds, especially along the coast, the San Juans and the 
NW interior may see winds approach wind advisory criteria, but 
that risk will need to be evaluated once this system enters the 
near term time frame.

Switching gears to higher elevations, snow levels remain high Monday 
before starting to lower Monday night and into Tuesday. With the 
aforementioned incoming moisture for Tuesday, accumulating snowfall 
will be an issue as snow levels by Tuesday night will dip down to 
pass level. Winter weather headlines may be needed if guidance 
remains consistent.

Wednesday brings a weak ridge, but unfortunately is not strong 
enough scour all of the moisture out of the area. As such, this will 
keep at least showers in the forecast...even though, thankfully, QPF 
values remain low during this time. A broad upper level trough over 
the northwestern Canadian coast will keep weather over W WA active 
for the remainder of the forecast period, continuing to cycle 
moisture into the area and keeping the latter end of the forecast 
wet.

18

&&

.AVIATION... 
Southwesterly flow aloft as an upper ridge begins to exit the area. 
Surface winds largely light and variable overnight before turning 
southerly at most terminals early Sunday morning with speeds 
increasing to 5 to 10 kts for much of the morning and early 
afternoon. Additional speed increases are expected for Sunday 
evening as an incoming front approaches the area.

Another evening of mixed cigs over W WA. Most terminals seeing VFR 
conditions however northern terminals and those along the west side 
of the Sound and along the Strait seeing MVFR to IFR conditions. 
Cigs lowering overnight, but the area looks to remain mixed: coastal 
locations will lower into MVFR while terminals around Puget Sound 
will be a mix of VFR to MVFR conditions. IFR conditions are possible 
for locations more prone to lower cigs. Mixing associated with a 
weak passing front Sunday afternoon may allow for some improvement 
to cigs, but any such improvement will only be slight as rain is 
expected to move into the area by the end of the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR conditions tonight into early Sunday morning. A weak 
front will begin to approach the terminal around 11Z, bringing some 
light showers with it. This will be enough to drag cigs to MVFR for 
the remainder of the morning before some improvement back to 
borderline VFR in the afternoon. Winds will remain southerly with 
speeds generally 4-8 kts for the TAF period.

.MARINE...
A weak frontal system will cross the waters through early Sunday, 
generating SCA winds and seas above 10 feet across the far northern 
coastal waters. Seas will remain between 6 to 9 feet elsewhere.

A stronger system will arrive late Sunday night into Monday, which 
will bring stronger winds to the outer waters that will likely reach 
Gale force. This system will also bring larger swells to the region, 
with waves reaching 15 to 20 feet early next week.

Seas will remain elevated throughout the rest of next week as 
another series of systems crosses the area waters. There will likely 
be another round of wind and sea headlines, with winds potentially 
reaching Gale force across most area waters mid week.

.HYDROLOGY...
Rivers continue to recede this afternoon as western Washington gets 
a break from the wet weather. Even the lower reaches of the rivers 
will approach or lower below flood stage later today into tonight. 
The exceptions to this will be the lower reaches of the Chehalis 
river which will not fall below flood stage until Sunday from Porter 
down to Grays Harbor, and the lower reaches of the Skagit river 
which will recede to near flood stage by Monday morning. 

Rivers will be on the rise again later Monday into Tuesday with 
another atmospheric river taking aim at Western Washington.
Rainfall amounts to 3 to 5 inches Monday through Wednesday in the 
mountains are forecast. Another round of river flooding will occur 
with the atmospheric river but at this time, with the Skagit and 
Snohomish Rivers forecast to reach major flooding once again by 
midweek. A Flood Watch has been issued for much of western 
Washington Monday morning through Thursday evening for potential 
incoming river flooding, urban flooding, and small stream flooding.

With very wet antecedent soil conditions, the landslide threat 
remains high across the region. Potential is also elevated for 
debris flows over area burn scars, which continue to be monitored.

The threat of urban flooding will increase again later Monday into 
Tuesday. Small stream flooding, as well as areas with poor drainage, 
will pose a risk of localized nuisance flooding and ponding on 
roadways later Monday into Wednesday.
